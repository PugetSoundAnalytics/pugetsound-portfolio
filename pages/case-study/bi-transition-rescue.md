# Case Study: BI Transition Rescue During Acquisition 

> **TL;DR**  
> The acquiring company’s BI team assumed we were a “simple one-SKU business” — but that SKU was a **personalized pharmaceutical**, with complex manufacturing, scheduling, regulatory, and safety requirements.
>
> I reviewed the limited plan, reset priorities, and delivered essential reports across scheduling, apheresis, sales, and accounting. At cut-over, I made the tough call to proceed knowing it would be bumpy, but confident patients would be served safely.

## Challenge  
 - Parent BI team treated the transition as a light lift, assuming “one SKU = simple.”
   - Reality: a personalized blood therapy with unique data requirements tied to patient safety, compliance, and manufacturing workflows.
 - The migration from Oracle, SSRS, Tableau, and SFDC into the parent’s warehouse, QlikView, and SFDC instance had barely started.
 - Critical reporting for scheduling, apheresis, and commercial sales had not begun and was actively challenged as “unnecessary.”
 - Accounting errors had already caused a multi-million-dollar vendor payment mistake, damaging relationships.

---

## My Role  
 - Returned as a **1099 consultant** funded from stakeholder budgets, after being laid off in the initial acquisition round.
 - Assessed the limited work and plan to date to identify gaps and reprioritize what truly mattered.
 - Advocated with the parent BI team that personalized pharma complexity meant “canned” reporting wasn’t sufficient.
 - Partnered with internal stakeholders to rebuild essential reporting, ensuring regulatory and operational continuity.
 - Made the **go/no-go recommendation** for data team at cut-over, balancing risks with patient safety and business needs.

---

## Solution  
 - Gap Assessment – Reviewed the parent BI team’s plan and early work, surfacing missing deliverables critical to safety and financial continuity.
 - Advocacy – Reframed the “simple SKU” narrative, showing why personalized therapies required custom reporting.
 - Business Continuity First – Delivered priority reports in scheduling, apheresis, sales, and accounting.
 - Corrective Action – Fixed the accounting reporting process after a multi-million-dollar vendor payment error.
 - Cut-Over Decision – Recommended “Go” despite some unfinished items, confident the essentials were in place to serve patients safely.
 - Stakeholder Coaching – Aligned expectations around what the new BI environment could (and couldn’t) do.
 - Backlog Creation – Documented and prioritized long-term reporting and data product needs.

## Impact  
- **Patient safety protected:** ensured therapies were tracked and delivered correctly through accurate scheduling and apheresis reporting.
- **Financial trust restored:** corrected reporting gaps that had triggered major vendor payment errors.
- **Stakeholder confidence rebuilt:** local teams gained trust through quick wins and a visible backlog.
- **Parent BI perception shifted:** recognized the complexity of personalized pharma, leading to stronger support.
- **Adoption improved:** smoother onboarding through focused coaching and stakeholder champions.

---

## Insights Unlocked  
- Assumptions can derail transitions: “single SKU” looked simple, but reality was highly complex.
- Influence requires range: sometimes I translated and coached; other times I was resolute in holding the acquiring BI team accountable through data agreements. The pushback was real, but so were the stakes. 
- Leadership under pressure: recommending “Go” at cut-over despite bumps proved the importance of confidence in people and process.
- Personal mission fuels resilience: having seen my grandfather suffer and die from prostate cancer, I wasn’t just rebuilding reports — I was ensuring patients got timely, safe treatments. That urgency gave me the fire to push through resistance and setbacks.
