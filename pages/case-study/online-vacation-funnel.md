# Case Study: Outdoor Adventures Funnel Conversion  

## Challenge  
An outdoor retailer’s online adventures funnel was designed to track how visitors engaged with trip content and moved toward booking. But when marketing teams reviewed conversion insights, the lightly processed Excel outputs were confusing. Leaders didn’t trust the data and couldn’t tailor messaging effectively.  

## My Role  
As part of online marketing analytics, I was asked to transform this data into an easily understood view of how customers progressed through the funnel.  

During my initial investigation, I discovered the same visitors were being counted in multiple funnel buckets, inflating totals and muddying the story of engagement. I partnered with the data science group to refine their extraction methodology, providing detailed visitor-level examples and running iterative tests.  

Once duplicate counts were cleansed and visitor bucketing was refined and validated, I turned my attention to communication. I designed interactive visualizations where any two data snapshots could be compared — making it easy to see whether, and where, visitors moved up or down the funnel via Sankey flows and pivot views.  

## Solution  
- Rebuilt adventure funnel data snapshots for accuracy.  
- Refined bucketing logic with cleansed visitor data.  
- Developed intuitive visualizations showing customer journeys clearly.  

## Impact  
- Restored confidence in funnel conversion metrics used by marketing leadership.  
- Revealed a more accurate picture of engagement and buying signals.  
- Enabled the marketing team to tailor messaging with precision, focusing on the stages where customers showed the clearest interest in booking.
