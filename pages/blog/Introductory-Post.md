## Introductory Blog Post

Hi, thanks for stopping by, I'm Jennifer Chin ðŸ‘‹ I'm a business analyst, data storyteller, consultatnt, and artist.

I've started a quest to connect with smart, kind, interesting people - and this blog is the first step.

My goal is to post to this blog once or twice a month with key insights and thoughts around my analytical adventures.

Stay tuned for my upcoming saga on how to take the creepy ick out of networking.

Please do connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennchin/) or want me to cover a [specific topic or idea]()!
