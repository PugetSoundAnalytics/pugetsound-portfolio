## Case Studies
Data doesn't create change - **people do**.  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 1.5rem; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <picture>
    <source 
      srcset="{{ '/assets/images/Data Journey.svg' | relative_url }}" 
      media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
    <img 
      src="{{ '/assets/images/Data Journey-white.svg' | relative_url }}" 
      alt="Data → Pattern → Narrative → Decision (continuous loop)"
      style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; align-self: flex-start;">
