## Why I Care: Data Illuminates Our Story

Every data point holds a story. Dashboards show whatâ€™s happening; stories reveal *why it matters* and *what to do next*.  

Data storytelling transforms raw numbers into clarity, empowers confident decisions, and uncovers opportunities spreadsheets miss.  

Here, youâ€™ll find explorations on:  
- **Narrative Craft** â€” Turning insights into action.  
- **Humanized Data** â€” Making numbers relatable and memorable.  
- **Wild Analytics** â€” Lessons and reflections from practice.  

This is where I explore, experiment, and share the stories behind numbers.
