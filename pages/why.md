## Every Number Has a Story

Behind every data point is a narrative waiting to be uncovered. Dashboards can show you whatâ€™s happening, but only stories reveal *why it matters* and *what to do next*.  

Data storytelling transforms raw information into clarity, empowers strategic decisions, and illuminates opportunities that spreadsheets alone canâ€™t surface.  

Here, youâ€™ll find explorations on:  
- **Crafting Compelling Narratives** â€” Going beyond charts to connect insights with action.  
- **Humanizing Data** â€” Making numbers relatable, memorable, and meaningful.  
- **Analytics in the Wild** â€” Lessons, experiments, and reflections from my journey blending consulting, creativity, and curiosity.
