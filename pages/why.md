## Why I Care: Data Illuminates Human Stories

Behind every data point is a story. Dashboards show what’s happening, but stories reveal *why it matters* and *what to do next*.  

Data storytelling transforms raw numbers into clarity, empowers decisions, and reveals opportunities spreadsheets can’t.  

Here, you’ll find explorations on:  
- **Narrative Craft** — Turning insights into action.  
- **Humanized Data** — Making numbers relatable and memorable.  
- **Analytics in the Wild** — Lessons and reflections from practice.  

This is where I explore, experiment, and share the stories behind the numbers.
