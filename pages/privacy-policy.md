## Privacy Policy

Your privacy matters. Here's exactly how I handle your information:

### Minimal Analytics, Maximum Privacy
I use [Google Analytics 4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681) with enhanced privacy settings enabled—specifically:
- **IP anonymization** is active, so IP addresses are not stored in full.
- No User-ID tracking or advertising features are enabled.
- No personalized advertising, remarketing, or retargeting.
  
This setup helps me understand general traffic patterns—such as which pages are most visited and where visitors come from—without collecting personally identifiable information.

### My Commitment to You
- **No personalized advertising or retargeting**—ever.
- **No intrusive tracking** of your personal browsing behavior.
- **No creepy data collection**—just simple, respectful analytics to improve your experience.

### Data You Provide Voluntarily
If you reach out via email or a contact form, I’ll use your information solely to respond and communicate with you directly. I never sell or share your personal information with third parties.

### Commitment to Your Privacy
I'm committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring your experience here is safe, enjoyable, and completely worry-free.

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out directly!
