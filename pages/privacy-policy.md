## Privacy Policy

Your privacy matters. Here's exactly how I handle your information:

### Minimal Analytics, Maximum Privacy
I use basic, privacy-friendly analytics (Google Analytics) only to understand general website traffic patterns—such as which pages are most visited, where visitors come from broadly, and how long they stay on the site. No personally identifiable or intrusive tracking is conducted.

### My Commitment to You
- **No personalized advertising or retargeting**—ever.
- **No intrusive tracking** of your personal browsing behavior.
- **No creepy data collection**—just simple, respectful analytics to improve your experience.

### Data You Provide Voluntarily
If you reach out via email or a contact form, I’ll use your information solely to respond and communicate with you directly. I never sell or share your personal information with third parties.

### Commitment to Your Privacy
I'm committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring your experience here is safe, enjoyable, and completely worry-free.

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out directly!
