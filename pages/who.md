    <h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Jenn, thanks for stopping by.</h3>
    <p>Iâ€™m a <b>data storyteller and artist</b> who finds hidden logic in the chaos of numbers, color, and ideas. With experience spanning <b>e-commerce, biotech, high tech, telecom, and consumer products</b>, I help organizations <b>transform raw data into clear stories</b> that inspire confident decisions and reveal new opportunities.</p>
    <p>Much like my art, my approach to analytics thrives on <b>structured serendipity</b>. Even with meticulous planning, data can surprise usâ€”patterns appear where none were expected. My role is to guide those discoveries into <b>meaningful narratives</b> that bring teams into alignment and drive business impact.</p>

### My Areas of Expertise

- **Data Storytelling & Visualization:** crafting insights that resonate, not just dashboards 
- **AI-Enhanced Analytics:** using tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to accelerate clarity 
- **Business Process Optimization & ERPs:** connecting data with workflows and outcomes 
- **KPI Development & Strategic Alignment:** ensuring metrics reflect what truly matters
- **Stakeholder Communication & Collaboration:** making complex stories accessible to every audience

Just as pigments flow unpredictably to form new shapes, I believe the best insights emerge where **analytics meets creativity**. My goal is always the same: to bring clarity from complexity and help leaders act with confidence.

When not uncovering data stories, youâ€™ll find me embracing the serendipitous dance of acrylic paint and gravity, crafting artworks that reflect the very essence of life's beautiful complexity.
