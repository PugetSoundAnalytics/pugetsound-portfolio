    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jenn, thanks for stopping by.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m a data analyst, visualization expert, and artist who sees hidden logic within the chaos of data and creativity alike. With extensive experience spanning e-commerce, biotech, high tech, telecom, and consumer products, I specialize in translating complex business information into clear, impactful insights.</p>
    <p>Much like my art, my analytical process thrives in structured serendipity. Even with meticulous planning, data can shift and surpriseâ€”patterns emerging where least expected. My role is to guide those surprises into meaningful stories, empowering businesses to make informed decisions and uncover new opportunities.</p>

### My Areas of Expertise

- **Data Storytelling & Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau, Qlik 
- **AI-Enhanced Analytics:** ChatGPT, Copilot  
- **Business Process Optimization & ERPs**  
- **KPI Development & Strategic Alignment**  
- **Stakeholder Communication & Collaboration** 

Just as pigments flow unpredictably, creating unexpected beauty, I believe that the best insights often arise at the intersection of structured analytics and creative thinking. My goal is always the same: to discover logic within chaos, creating clarity from complexity.

When not exploring dashboards or data-driven strategies, youâ€™ll find me embracing the serendipitous dance of acrylic paint and gravity, crafting artworks that reflect the very essence of life's beautiful complexity.
