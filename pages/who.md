    <h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Jenn Chinâ€”a data storyteller and artist who transforms complexity into clarity.</h3>
    <p>Across industries from <strong>e-commerce to biotech, telecom to consumer products</strong>, I help leaders uncover the narratives hidden in their data. My work turns raw numbers into stories that inspire confident decisions and spark new opportunities.</p>
    <p>Much like my art, my approach to analytics thrives on <strong>structured serendipity</strong>. Even with meticulous planning, data can surprise usâ€”patterns appear where none were expected. My role is to guide those discoveries into <strong>meaningful narratives</strong> that bring teams into alignment and drive business impact.</p>

### My Areas of Expertise

- **Data Storytelling & Visualization:** transforming analytics into narratives that resonate and drive action 
- **AI-Enhanced Insights:** applying emerging tools to accelerate clarity and decision-making 
- **Business Process Alignment & Optimization:** connecting workflows, systems, and outcomes for measurable impact  
- **KPI Development & Strategic Alignment:** ensuring metrics reflect what truly matters 
- **Stakeholder Communication & Collaboration:** making complex stories accessible across teams and leadership levels 

Just as pigments flow unpredictably into new shapes, I believe the best insights emerge where **analytics meets creativity**. My goal: bring clarity from complexity and help leaders act with confidence.

When not uncovering data stories, youâ€™ll find me embracing the serendipitous dance of acrylic paint and gravity, crafting artworks that reflect the very essence of life's beautiful complexity.
