## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Jenn, thanks for stopping by.

I'm a data analyst, visualization expert, and artist who sees the hidden logic within the chaos of data and creativity alike. With extensive experience spanning e-commerce, biotech, high tech, telecom, and consumer products, I specialize in translating complex business information into clear, impactful insights.

Much like my art, my analytical process thrives in structured serendipity. Even with meticulous planning, data can shift and surprise—patterns emerging where least expected. My role is to guide those surprises into meaningful stories, empowering businesses to make informed decisions and uncover new opportunities.

My key areas of expertise include:

• Data storytelling & visualization (Power BI, Tableau)

• AI-enhanced analytics (ChatGPT, Copilot)

• Business process optimization & ERP solutions

• KPI development and strategic alignment

• Effective stakeholder communication & collaboration

Just as pigments flow unpredictably, creating unexpected beauty, I believe that the best insights often arise at the intersection of structured analytics and creative thinking. My goal is always the same: to discover logic within chaos, creating clarity from complexity.

When not exploring dashboards or data-driven strategies, you’ll find me embracing the serendipitous dance of acrylic paint and gravity, crafting artworks that reflect the very essence of life's beautiful complexity.
