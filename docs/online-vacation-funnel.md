# Case Study: Outdoor Retailer Adventures Funnel Conversion

## Challenge
Online outdoor adventures client funnel was designed to track how visitors engaged with trips content and moved toward booking. But when marketing teams reviewed conversion insights, the lightly process data in Excel was confusing. Marketing leaders didn't trust the data and couldn't tailor messaging effectively. 

## My Role
As part of online marketing analytics, I was asked to take this data and create an easily understood method to show how customers progressed through the funnel. During my initial data investigation, I discovered the same visitors were being counted in multiple funnel buckets, creating inflated totals and muddying the story of engagement. I worked in partnership with the data science group to refine their data extraction methodology by providing detailed visitor bug data examples and iterative testing. Once the duplicate visitor counts were cleansed and visitor bucketing was refined and validated; the data was aligned; however the presentation was still lacking clarity. Next I created an interactive visualizations in which any two data snapshots could be compared and you could see whether and where each visitor traveled up or down the funnel - via sankey and pivots.

## Solution
 - Rebuild outdoor adventures data snapshots
 - Refine bucketing logic with cleansed data
 - Process data into understandable visuals that displayed the customer's journey

## Impact
 - Restored confidence in funnel conversion metrics used by marketing leadership.
 - Revealed a more accurate picture of increasing engagement and buying signals.
 - Enabled the marketing team to tailor messaging with precision, focusing outreach on the stages where customers were showing the clearest interest in booking.
