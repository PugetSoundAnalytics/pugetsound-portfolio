</div>

I used to think vision boards were woo-woo.  
Like “manifesting yachts and dream houses” woo-woo.  

But recently, I tried making one—not to summon a yacht ala *The Secret*, but as a simple art project to rekindle my spark. I was feeling stuck, and this creative project looked playfully easy and tactile enough to shake me loose.  

The idea came from a workshop I watched on Creativebug (via a Hoopla BingePass from my library). The instructor walked through making a New Year’s vision board. I loved the concept, but instead of “new year, new me,” I created a **birthday vision board**—a compass for what I wanted in my *next trip around the sun.*

## Step 1: Set the Stage  

I began with a list of words that answered two simple questions:  

- What do I want more of in my life?  
- What do I want to feel?  

**For me it was: _awe, movement, joy, healing, connection, community, seeking, gardening, making, laughter._**  

As I wrote them all over the board—both to remove blank-page stress and to make the words real—I thought about how they might look in my everyday life:  
- *Connection* → friends and familty gathered  
- *Joy* → creating a more beautiful backyard garden  
- *Seeking* → curiosity of places near and far

Then I spray painted textures across the surface so I wouldn’t feel pressured to “cover everything” with images or worry about perfection.

## Step 2: Let the Process Take You  

With those seed words in mind, I flipped through magazines asking myself: *What do these words look like? How do I want to design my life?*  

Resonant images leapt out:  
- people gathered around a fire ring  
- gardens and lush green spaces  
- cozy interiors that inspired warmth and comfort  

And certain phrases demanded to be included:  
- *Aged to Perfection*  
- *Wonder Awaits*  
- *Force of Nature*  
- *Happy Places*  
- *Resilient / Radiant*  
- *Signature, Not Subtle*  
- *Superpower*  
- *Seeking Beauty*  

I cut, sorted into themes, and laid them out. The board came alive. I hummed a tune and smiled as I pasted.

## Step 3: Use the Compass for Navigation  

Once finished, I hung the collage above my desk. At first it was just decoration. I’d glance at it, maybe take a walk when I noticed the exercise imagery, or water my shrubs when the garden pictures called to me.  

But then something unexpected happened: the board started shaping my **decisions.**  

When new opportunities came up, I found myself asking:  
- Does this connect with wonder, awe, or joy?  
- Will it leave me resilient, or just drained?  
- Does it let me use my superpowers—or treat me like a commodity?  

Suddenly, choices became clearer. It wasn’t about money or pressure—it was about alignment.

## How This Works for Me  

The vision board isn’t some cheesy Harry Potter spell.  

It’s a picture of my **values and dreams**—always ready for me to test opportunities against.  

Discernment personified. It emboldens that little voice inside me that whispers: *this, not that.*

## My Surprise Takeaway  

A fun birthday art project turned into one of the most practical tools I’ve ever used.  

I went in expecting “woo.” I came out with a **decision-making compass.**  

The visual reminder I keep above my desk:  
👉 *If it drains you at any price, it’s already too expensive.*
