</div>

I used to think vision boards were woo-woo.
Like ‚Äúmanifesting yachts and dream houses‚Äù woo-woo.

But recently, I tried making one‚Äînot to summon a yacht ala _The Secret_, but as a simple art project to rekindle my spark. I was feeling stuck, and this creative project looked playfully easy and tactile enough  to shake myself loose.

The idea came from a workshop I watched on Creativebug (via a Hoopla BingePass from my library). The instructor walked through making a New Year‚Äôs vision board. I loved the concept, but instead of ‚Äúnew year, new me,‚Äù I decided to create a birthday vision board‚Äîa compass for what I wanted in my next trip around the sun.

## Step 1: Set the Stage

I began with a list of words that answered two simple questions:

 - What do I want more of in my life?
 - What do I want to feel?

**For me it was: _awe, movement, joy, healing, connection, community, seeking, gardening, making, laughter._**

As I wrote them down, all over the board - both to remove the blank page stress and to make the words real to me, I thought about what those words would look like in my real, everyday life. 

Then I spray painted textures over the enire surface so I wouldn't worry about whether I would have enough pictures to cover it all or feel constrained by the need to group pictures around specific words.

## Step 2: Let the Process Take You

Then I flipped through magazines with those seed words in mind - how do I want to design my life - what do those words look like?

When I found resonant pictures I tore them out:
 - people gathered around a fire ring - and thought about fire rings of the past - the friends and community I wanted to bring back into my life
 - so many gardens and how I enjoy walking my font yard with its landscaping growing in and how much I yearned for the same joy in the backyard
 - how cozy my house is and what would further cultivate that vibe

I also found phrases that really landed and needed to be included:
 - Aged to Perfection
 - Wonder Awaits
 - Force of Nature
 - Happy Places
 - Resilient / Radiant
 - Signature, Not Subtle
 - Superpower
 - Seeking Beauty

I cut the torn pages down to what felt right, sorted it all out into theme piles, and then I laid them out...and the board came alive...I hummed a tune and smiled as I pasted and pasted.

## Step 3: Use the Compass for Navigation

Once finished, I hung the collaged board above my desk. I‚Äôd glance at it now and then, noticing what drew my eye. I'd see the the exercise illustration and go for a walk or the garden pics and water my shrubs. But then something unexpected happened: it started shaping my decisions.

When a new opportunity came up, I found myself asking:
 - Does this connect with wonder, awe, or joy?
 - Will it leave me resilient, or just drained?
 - Does it let me use my superpowers‚Äîor treat me like a commodity?

Suddenly, choices became clearer. It wasn‚Äôt about money or pressure‚Äîit was about alignment.

## How This Works For Me

The vision board isn't some cheesy Harry Potter magic spell.

It is a literal picture of my values and dreams, ever at the ready to bounce opportunities against to see what fits.

Discernment personified - it enboldens that little voice inside me that helps me choose this and not that.

## My Suprise Takeaway

A fun birthday art project turned into one of the most practical tools I've ever used.

The visional reminder to myself:
üëâ If it drains you at any price, it‚Äôs already too expensive.

## Curious: Have you ever tried a creative exercise that surprised you by becoming a serious tool in your work or life?
