This month I got a ton done...just not wearing my analyst hat.

I soft re-launched my artist site, published a puzzle book on Amazon, set up Gumroad with freebies, sent my first studio newsletter in years, and rolled a LinkedIn announcement. I also felt a little dread about “needing” to publish on my analytics blog. So here’s the honest version, shaped by the words in the image.

## Configuration Is Discretionary
Defaults are suggestions, not destinies. My systems are seasonal: some months are heavy on dashboards; this one is heavy on making. I’m letting the configuration match reality—lighter tooling, more art—and calling that intentional, not lazy.  

**Try this:** choose one channel, one ask, one asset. Ship those; ignore the rest for seven days.  

## Permission Is Inherent
No gatekeeper is required to hit publish. Legitimacy doesn’t come from a posting streak; it comes from usefulness. If a single honest note helps one person (including me), it counts.

**Tiny script you can steal:**  
_“I made this to help someone like me this week. If it helps you, tell me one line about why.”_

## You Have Root Access
The switches I control today:
 - Scope: done = ~400 words + one image
 - Stakes: one specific reader, not “the internet”
 - Speed: 60-minute box; anything bigger gets sliced

## You Are Your Own sysadmin
Uptime is energy. My maintenance rituals right now:  
 - Patch: replace “shoulds” with a single next action.
 - Logs: one-line entry after I ship: [date] | what I shipped | where I shared | one note.
 - Reboot: go for a walk, drink some water, and listen to music.

When momentum is steady again, I’ll add instruments (Search Console, a key event or two). Not before.

## What I’m Learning
- Small loops are kinder and more repeatable than ambitious sprints.
- A post can be a **permission slip** and still be useful.
- My voice lands best when I write to one person I know.
- The work grows faster when I leave room for play.
- Configuration can be beautiful because it’s discretionary.

**PS:** If you try the one-line log, I’d love to hear what you notice after a week.
