Not long after I launched this blog, a former colleague reached out with enthusiasm and support. It felt great! Bing-Bang-Boom - Connection! Possibility! Maybe even collaboration! We set up a meeting, and during our chat, they floated the idea of recording a spontaneous podcast episode together.

I hadn’t even mentioned a podcast; I'm working on starting a blog...but I appreciated their excitement, I could see the idea's potential, it sounded fun. I said I was game if they wanted to schedule something, and since my calendar was (ahem) wide open thanks to the job hunt, I left the ball in their court.

And then... nothing. No follow-up. No reschedule. And, to be honest, I didn’t follow up either.

Not because I was bitter, or even disappointed. But because somewhere in my gut, I wasn’t sure whether this idea would energize or exhaust me. And in this season of career shifts, creativity, and recalibration, that’s becoming my most important filter.

## The New Networking Rule: Follow the Energy
We talk about “following up” like it’s a moral obligation. But what if we reframed it?

Instead of “Should I chase this down?” ask:
“Would this light me up—or weigh me down?”

Networking doesn’t have to be a hustle. It can be slow, mutual, and full of grace. You’re allowed to let a maybe fade into the background without it being a failure. Not every connection needs to produce something. For me, the value was being seen, doing a quick catch up talking to a peer I hadn't seen in a very long time, and laughing.

## What I’m Learning
It’s okay to say yes to a possibility and still not pursue it.

It’s okay to leave space instead of filling every silence with effort.

It’s okay to value clarity over complexity.

So if you're job hunting, networking, or just trying to “put yourself out there,” and you're wondering whether to follow up or move on—ask what your energy is trying to tell you. It’s often wiser than we give it credit for.

And if you're also wondering how to network in a way that doesn’t feel like a second job or an awkward sales pitch… stay tuned.  

That post is coming too.  

Eventually.  

When it energizes me.
