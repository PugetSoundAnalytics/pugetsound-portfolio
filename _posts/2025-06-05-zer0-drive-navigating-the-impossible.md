Ask me about zero, and my brain ignites. It all began with the [Radiolab episode 'Zeroworld'](https://radiolab.org/podcast/zeroworld/transcript) and their fascinating discussion with Karim Ani about dividing by zero. 

Yes, my friend, if you've worked with numbers for even a short while you will run into this phenom; it is not the stopping point, but the beginning of a journey into creative analytical problem-solving and solutions - there are many reasons why and how divide by zero happens - and each has a multiverse of solutions to choose from. You could say a large part of the job of creative data solutions hinges upon error handling analytics.

## Facing down the Zero Error in Analytics

The zero error can rear its ugly head in many ways, and while not an exhaustive list, these are the top three I've run into:

  - Beginning of the **insert time reference here** *(zero divided by zero)*
    
    For instance, in sales dashboards, at the start of a quarter, there would often be no current-quarter data available, resulting in errors where clear rankings appeared just a day prior. 

    If there's a data lag, ensure the report's date accounts for that delay e.g., using use today()-x or max(date)
    
  - Goal/Budget/Forecast not approved/loaded/etc. *(non-zero number divided by zero/null)*

    You can use error handling for this, however, even better is adding some logic or annotation to inform why e.g., "Budget for Q3 is forthcoming"
  
  - Upstream data issue *(the unexpected zero)*
    
    This scenario frequently signals the start of deeper investigation and can surface valuable opportunities.  
    Common issues include:  
    - Unexpected server restarts
    - Data load failures
    - Currupted data 
    - Human entry errors
    - Process breakdowns (manual or automated)
      
    In many cases, these types of situations necessitate the creation of alerts and/or audit reports to show sources tick and tie together

**TL;DR**  *By far the most useful syntax for handling divide by zero errors is IFERROR(numerator/denominator,0)*

## Turning Numbers Inside-Out
*What if the zero division error doesn't cause an error, but turns numbers inside-out?*

Our ship, Intrepid, is the first in the fleet to get **Zer0 Drive**. Intrepid is the crack force ready to travel at a moment's notice and will be ready on-site to help within minutes of your call. While we are the best at what we do, it's really the **Zer0 Drive** that has enabled our SLA to be as close to instantaneous as you can get. I don't understand the mechanics of it, but the chief engineer explained it like so: Imagine wearing a sweater; normally, you're inside, and everything else is outside. Now picture pulling that sweater over your head, flipping it inside out. Suddenly, the outside becomes inside, allowing any two points on the original outside to touch. They continued ad nauseam in excruciating technical detail, but the gist is space-time folds enabling instantaneous travel, all thanks to some esoteric research done on zero and how any given integer [is bigger on the inside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS).

Analytic insights are fueled by challenge - when actively engaging with constraints you can transform them into possibilities. This is the very basis of managing by exception (for instance: sending alerts instead of looking at everything all at once). When you are faced with a bowl of lemons, think about how great lemonade will taste once you slice into it.

## In Case of Emergency - Break Glass
*What if the zero-division error could be harnessed as an emergency-only and ultimately self-destructive perpetual motion generator?*

Our ship, Intrepid, is the coziest zeppelin I've seen â€” and the *Dread Pirate Roberts* has unfortunately noticed this, spotting us over the Seychelles and is rapidly approaching. The wind is not in our favor, but fear not, we have prepared for this moment. Get ready with the oil can, once I break the glass and pull the **Zer0 Drive** lever, our engine will start a [furious nonstop loop of activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU9ICaPZUCg) that will only stop when we run out of petrol or it pulls itself apart. You'll keep the cogs oiled; I'll keep the fuel flowing and will navigate around any mountain peaks on our mad dash. Once they fall past the horizon, we'll change course and hide in a cloud. Yes, I have a cloud seeding solution if there aren't any about when we get there, but that's for later, for now let's keep focused on the problem at hand.

The most creative solutions come about from necessity. While not ideal, a quick and dirty win can turn the tide. If the MVP is crude, but can get you past the hurdle, and is the best to be done with the allotted resources, **AND** your stakeholders understand the trade-offs being made to get to the finish line, do it. When your brain is on fire, you need to go to the emergency room, not schedule an appointment with a neurologist.

## Networking Gone Wild 
*What if listening to a podcast about zero division caused you to send a cringy fan-girl message*

I, your Intrepid blog hostess, am sadly guilty of taking advantage of a free trial of LinkedIn Premium so I could send a fan-girl message to Karim Ani encouraging him to pick up this research again. Remember back when you were a kid, and you learned about counting by tens, and you would have zero to 100 counting contests during recess. The rule was counting by tens was allowed, but anything larger was cheating, and you would scream the numbers in such quick succession at each other they just about merged into one word? **I am such a geek.** Anyway, think about that child-like excitement filling your being at the idea of the infinity of zero and all the possibilities, and wanting the person who thought they may sometime "sit in the desert and meditate" on a new math that starts with dividing by zero, to pursue this idea further. Yep, that excited fangirl was **me**.

This story - is a prime example of what **NOT** to do when intending to make a meaningful connection with someone. I've been threatening to write a post about "How to Take the Creepy Ick-Factor out of Networking," but I had to come clean on this first. And, upon reflection, shows the usual lengths one might go to out of curiosity and passion in analytics and storytelling.

## Insight: Infinite Possibilities Abound
Creative analytical thinking, data storytelling, and strategic risk-taking, especially around 'impossible' concepts like zero, strengthen your analytics error-handling toolkit. When you're stuck on a concept or bit of code, take a walk to let a little whimsy into your journey. The oddest thought or pop culture quip from a colleague may be all you need to get you back on track.

Do you have experiences or unique insights about dividing by zero, innovative analytics solutions, or imaginative explorations into infinity?

I'd love to hear your epic zero-handling techniques or your most creative data-driven adventures!
