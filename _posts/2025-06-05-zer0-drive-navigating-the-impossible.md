</div>


If you ask me about zero, my brain catches fire. I blame the episode [Radiolab - Zeroworld](https://radiolab.org/podcast/zeroworld/transcript) and their chat with Karim Ani, where they talk about dividing by zero. 

Yes my friend, if you've worked with numbers for even a short while you will run into this phenom; it is not the stopping point, but the beginning of a journey into creative problem solving and solutioning - there are many reasons why divide by zero happens and how - and each has a multiverse of solutions to choose from.

## Facing down the Zero Error in Analytics
The zero error can rear it's ugly head in many different ways, and while not an exhaustive list, these are the top three I've run into:
  - Beginning of the **insert time reference here** (zero divided by zero)
  - Goal/Budget/Forecast not approved/loaded/etc yet (actual divided by zero/null)
  - Upstream data issue (the unexpected zero)

## Turning Numbers Inside-Out
*What if dividing by zero, doesn't cause and error, but turns numbers inside-out?*

Our ship, Intrepid, is the first in the fleet to to get **Zer0 Drive**. Intrepid is the crack force ready to travel at a moments notice, and will be ready on-site to help within minutes of your call. While we are the best at what we do, it's really the **Zer0 Drive** that has enabled our SLA to be as close to instantaneous as you can get. I don't understand the mechanics of it, but the chief engineer explained it like so: you're wearing a sweater, and because are wearing it, we can both agree, you are inside it, and everything is outside it, but then you take the sweater and pull it up over your head flipping everything outside in, you are still inside the sweater (because the inside is now outside), but now, any point outside the sweater can touch any other point outside the sweater - because the outside is in, you can then get any the two points to touch and then flip the sweater back down over your head. They talked on and on in technical jargon, but the gist is space-time folds enabling instantanious travel, all thanks to some esoteric research done on zero and how any given integer [is bigger on the inside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS).

Analytic insights are fueled by challenge - when actively engaging with constraints you can transform them into possibilities. This is the very basis of managing by exception (for instance: sending alerts instead of looking at everything all at once). When you are faced with a bowl of lemons, think about how great that lemonaide will taste once you slice into it.

## In Case of Emergency - Break Glass
*What if dividing by zero, could be an emergency-only and ultimately self-distructive perpetual motion generator?*

Our ship, Intrepid, is the coziest zeplin of any I've seen - and I've seen a few. Apparently pirates are just as adept at noticing the coziest zeplin this side of the meridean as I; as unfortunately, pirates have spotted us cruising lazily over the Seychelles and are closing fast. The wind is not in our favor, but fear not, we have prepared for this moment. Get ready with the oil can, once I break the glass and pull the **Zer0 Drive** lever, our engine will start a [furious nonstop loop of activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU9ICaPZUCg) that will only stop when we run out of petrol or it pulls itself appart. You'll keep the cogs oiled, I'll keep the fuel flowing and will navigate around any mountain peaks on our mad dash. Once they fall past the horizon, we'll change course and hide in a cloud. Yes, I have cloud seeding solution if there aren't any about when we get there, but that's for later, for now let's keep focused on the problem at hand.

The most creative solutions come about from necessity. While not ideal, a quick and dirty win can turn the tide. If the MVP is crude, but is able to get you past the hurdle, and is the best to be done with the alotted resources, **AND** your stakeholders understand the trade-offs being made to get to the finish line, do it. When your brain is on fire, you need to go to the emergency room, not schedule an appointment with a neurologist.

## Networking Gone Wild 
*What if listening to a podcast about dividing by zero caused you to send a cringy fan-girl message*

I, your Intrepid blog hostest, is sadly guilty of taking advantage of a free trial of LinkedIn Premium so I could send a fan-girl message to Karim Ani encouraging him to pick up this research again. Remember back when you were a kid, and you learned about counting by tens, and you would have 0 to 100 counting contests during recess, and the rules were you could count by tens, but counting by anything greater was cheating, and you would scream the numbers in such quick succession at eachother they just about merged into one word? **I am such a geek** Anyway, think about that child-like excitement filling your being at the idea of the infinity of zero and all the possibilities, and wanting the person who thought they may sometime "sit in the desert and meditate" on a new math that starts with dividing by zero, to do it. ---> **me** <---

This story - is a prime example what not to do when intending to make meaningful connection with someone. I've been threatening to write a post about "How to Take the Creepy Ick-Factor out of Networking," but I had to come clean on this first. And, upon reflection, shows the usual lengths one might go to out of curiosity and passion in analytics and storytelling.
