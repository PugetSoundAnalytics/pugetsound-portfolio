Ask me about zero, and my brain ignites. It all began with the [Radiolab episode 'Zeroworld'](https://radiolab.org/podcast/zeroworld/transcript) and their fascinating discussion with Karim Ani about dividing by zero. 

If you've worked with numbers for even a short while, you will run into this phenomenon. But zero isn't the end; it's the start of a journey into creative analytical problem-solving. Divide-by-zero errors frequently occur in analytics, and each scenario requires innovative error-handling solutions.

## Facing down the Zero Error

The divide-by-zero error can surface in numerous ways. While not exhaustive, here are three common situations:

  - Beginning of a reporting period *(zero/null divided by zero/null)*  
    For example, in sales dashboards at the start of a quarter, there's often no data, leading to errors where clear rankings appeared just a day prior.  
      - Adjust report dates to accommodate data lag, e.g., using today()-1 or max(date)
    
  - Goal/Budget/Forecast not loaded *(non-zero number divided by zero/null)*
      - Implement error handling or better yet, annotate the scenario clearly: "Budget for Q3 is forthcoming."
  
  - Upstream data issue *(the unexpected zero/null)*  
    These scenarios often signal deeper problems and opportunities for improvement.    
    Common issues include:
      - Unexpected server restarts
      - Data load failures
      - Corrupted data 
      - Human entry errors
      - Process breakdowns (manual or automated)
      
    Often, resolving these issues involves creating alerts or audit reports to ensure data integrity and consistency.

**TL;DR**  *The most reliable way to handle divide-by-zero errors is some version of IFERROR(numerator/denominator,0), but it is **CRITICAL** to understand the why behind the error first.*

## Turning Numbers Inside-Out
*What if zero-division didn't cause an error but instead turned numbers inside-out?*

Our ship, *Intrepid*, is the fleet's first vessel equipped with **Zer0 Drive**. Our elite crew stands ready to deploy at a moment's notice, and this extraordinary technology enables our service-level agreement (SLA) to be virtually instantaneous. I don't fully grasp the mechanics, but the chief engineer describes it as follows: Imagine wearing a sweater. Normally, you're inside it, and everything else is outside. Now, flip the sweater inside-out over your head; this allows any two points on the outside to touch. They continued ad nauseam in excruciating technical detail, the gist of which is space-time folds enabling instantaneous travel, all thanks to some esoteric research on zero division and how any given integer is [bigger on the inside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS).

Tough challenges spark insight. Actively engaging with constraints transforms them into possibilities, laying the foundation for managing by exception (e.g., sending alerts rather than reviewing everything in excruciating  detail). When faced with a bowl of lemons, envision the delicious lemonade you'll soon enjoy.

## In Case of Emergency - Break Glass
*What if a zero-division error could serve as an emergency-only self-destructive perpetual motion generator?*

Our ship, *Intrepid*, is the coziest zeppelin I've ever seen — and unfortunately, the *Dread Pirate Roberts* agrees. They've spotted us leisurely cruising over the Seychelles and are rapidly approaching. The winds aren't favorable, but fear not, we're prepared. Ready the oil can! Once I break the glass and pull the **Zer0 Drive** lever, our engine will enter a [furious nonstop loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU9ICaPZUCg) only ceasing when we run out of petrol or it tears itself apart. You oil the gears; I'll manage fuel and navigate around any mountain peaks. Once we lose our chaser, we'll hide in the clouds. I have a cloud-seeding solution if the need arises.

The most innovative solutions often emerge from necessity. A quick and dirty MVP could be your salvation, provided stakeholders understand the trade-offs involved. Instead of waiting for the perfect solution, start work and move toward perfection.

## Networking Gone Wild 
*Ever been inspired by zero division to send a cringy fan message?*

I'm guilty of leveraging a free LinkedIn Premium trial to send Karim Ani an enthusiastic message encouraging him to continue his research on dividing by zero. Did you participate in counting contests during recess? A rapid-fire counting by tens that merges numbers into one breathless word? That same childlike excitement filled me, inspiring me to encourage a stranger’s intellectual pursuit. Yes, that excited fangirl was **me**.

This anecdote illustrates exactly **what not to do** when networking. I've teased a forthcoming blog post, "How to Take the Creepy Ick-Factor out of Networking," but first, a confession was in order. Curiosity and passion for analytics and storytelling can lead us to some unusual actions.

## Insight: Infinite Possibilities Abound
Creative analytical thinking, data storytelling, and strategic risk-taking, especially around 'impossible' concepts like zero, strengthen your analytics error-handling toolkit. When you're stuck on an error or tricky code, take a beat; the oddest thought or pop culture reference from a colleague might spark your next breakthrough.
