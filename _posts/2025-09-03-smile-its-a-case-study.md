We often write case studies for others — clients, recruiters, or hiring managers — to show what we did, how we did it, and what impact it had.

But something unexpected happened while I was working on [this case study](https://pugetsoundanalytics.com/case-study/online-vacation-funnel/):  
**I started remembering things I had forgotten.**

Not just dates or tools. But the tiny moments that mattered — the iterative SQL fixes, the dashboard performance hacks, the creative decisions that shifted the narrative, and the moment the fog lifted for the marketing team.

And along with those memories?  
That deeply satisfying smile.  
The one you get when you realize:  
*“I did something meaningful. I made a difference.”*

This process reminded me that:
- Writing isn't just for *others* — it’s for *ourselves.*
- Documenting our work can reignite pride and perspective.
- Reflection gives us not just a story to tell — but a deeper connection to our own growth.

So if you’re feeling a little fuzzy on what you’ve accomplished lately, I highly recommend revisiting one of your past wins.  
Not to polish it up for the world (though that’s great too), but to remember *you* were the one who made it work.

And if it brings a smile?  
That’s the best kind of metric.
