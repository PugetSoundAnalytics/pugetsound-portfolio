---


🌍 Situation:
My extensive music collection, stored across various cloud platforms and storage devices, was fragmented, messy, and worst of all, subject to tracking and restrictive controls.

🎯 Task:
I want complete ownership, privacy, and easy access to my entire music collection—anytime, anywhere. The goal was clear: build a fully self-hosted, privacy-focused media server.

🚀 Action:
Researched and purchased suitable hardware components.

Raw Data Collection - Reclaimed and downloaded all my cloud-hosted music, random files on my laptop, and dug out my old WD Passport HD

Data Cleansing - Extracted, organized, and meticulously cleaned the metadata using MusicBrainz Picard.

Data Integrity & Redundancy - Set up RAID 1 storage and backups for the metadata enriched music files.

Building Secure, Accessible Dashboards - Configured Plex Media Server, ensuring robust security and seamless remote access.

🏆 Result:
Now, I have a fully private, streamlined, beautifully organized, and instantly accessible media library. I enjoy total privacy, control, and the freedom to stream my music seamlessly—no tracking, no restrictions.
