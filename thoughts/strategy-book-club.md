## The Speed Isn’t Strategy Book Club

We’re told to move faster. Do more. With less.  
But speed alone doesn’t create success—left unchecked, it becomes a saboteur.

This short deck explores how ideas from three books helped me reframe change:
- ***Work Clean* by Dan Charnas**
- ***Finding Ultra* by Rich Roll**
- ***Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman**

It’s a visual warm-up to a longer blog post (**coming soon**).
