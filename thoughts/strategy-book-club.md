## The Speed Isnâ€™t Strategy Book Club

Weâ€™re told to move faster. Do more. With less.  
But speed alone doesnâ€™t create successâ€”it often becomes a saboteur.

This short deck explores how ideas from three books helped me reframe change:
- *Work Clean* by Dan Charnas
- *Finding Ultra* by Rich Roll
- *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman

Itâ€™s a visual warm-up to a longer blog post (coming soon).
